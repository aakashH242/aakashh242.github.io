I am an engineer with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

I’ve worked in IT services MNCs for 10+ years, mainly on backend development, devops, API platforms, platform engineering and generative AI.

At present, I am working on building my solutions for the gaps and pain points I faced.  

I also help early-founders, marketers and product owners build and productionize their projects.

I prefer `tabs` over `spaces`. They just take lesser keystrokes. :P

Here, I shall share my technical notes, projects, and experiments.
